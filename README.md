This repository demonstrates a common Perl error: accessing an array element outside its defined bounds. The `bug.pl` file contains the erroneous code, while `bugSolution.pl` provides a corrected version that handles potential out-of-bounds access gracefully.  This is crucial to prevent unexpected program crashes or unpredictable results.
